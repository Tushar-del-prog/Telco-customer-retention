# Telco-customer-retention
Dataset for Telco customer churn prediction project

This repository contains a dataset related to **customer churn prediction** in the telecom industry. The aim is to analyze customer behavior and build models to **predict whether a customer will leave (churn)** or stay with the telecom service.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview

The dataset includes **demographic info, account details, and services** used by each customer. It can be used to explore patterns, perform feature engineering, and build classification models.

- File Name: `telco_data.csv`
- Rows: ~7,000+
- Target Variable: `Churn`


## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

**To predict whether a customer will churn (leave the company), based on their service usage patterns, demographic information, and account behavior.**

Understanding why customers churn helps telecom companies improve customer retention strategies.
